# Overview

This PD example is a simple demonstration based on the MCUXpresso SDK PD stack.
@n The application use the board keys and debug console to test the PD functions.
@n The demo works as DRP. When connect, the board can be source or sink.

# System Requirement

## Hardware requirements

- Two Type-C shield boards
- Two 9V DC power suppliers
- Type-C Cable
- Two hardwares (Tower module/base board, and so on) for a specific device, for example: two lpcxpresso54114 boards
- Personal Computer


## Software requirements

- The project files are in: 
@n <MCUXpresso_SDK_Install>/boards/<board>/usb_examples/usb_pd/<rtos>/<toolchain>.
@note The <rtos> is Bare Metal or FreeRTOS OS.
- Terminal tool.


# Getting Started

## Hardware Settings

@n For detailed instructions, see the appropriate board User's Guide.
@note Set the hardware jumpers (Tower system/base module) to default settings.


## Prepare the example

1.  For MCUXpresso, please reference to the MCUXpresso SDK USB Type-C PD Stack User's Guide to make sure the SDK_DEBUGCONSOLE = 1 in project settings.
2.  Download the program to the target board.
3.  Power on Type-C shield board then power on development board.

# Run the example

1.  Download this program to two boards, connect these two boards with Type-C cable.
2.  Connect two boards' OpenSDA USB port to the PC and open terminal.
3.  Request power from sink role.
    - Long press "Power request SW" for about 3s on the board to make 9V request. After the request is completed successfully, the VBus voltage is 9V.
    - Short press "Power request SW" on the board to make 5V request. After the request is completed successfully, the VBus voltage is 5V.
4.  Power swap
    - Short press "Power change SW" on the board to make PR_SWAP.
    - The Voltage of the vbus will drop to 0V and then back to 5V.
    - After success, the power roles are changed.
5.  Hard reset
    - Long press "Power change SW" on the board to make HARD_RESET.
    - The Voltage of the vbus will drop to 0V and then back to 5V.
    - Source and sink state machine will re-start and sink will request power again, you can see the logs in the debug console.
6.  Test other commands
    - Input ‘0’ in the debug console, the follow menu will print in the debug console (the menu is little different for source and sink):
      @image html demo_menu.jpg
      @image latex demo_menu.jpg "demo menu"
    - Input the menu to test the corresponding command.
    - For example: you input ‘g’, “data role swap” command will start, the debug console will print the result.
7.  The demo's default configuration is PD2.0. To test the PD3.0 command, PD_CONFIG_REVISION need be changed from PD_SPEC_REVISION_20 to PD_SPEC_REVISION_30 in usb_pd_config.h file.
    Then input '0' in the debug console, some PD3.0 related commands menu are added.
8.  For compliance test, PD_CONFIG_COMPLIANCE_TEST_ENABLE, PD_CONFIG_TRY_SNK_SUPPORT and PD_CONFIG_TRY_SRC_SUPPORT need be enable in usb_pd_config.h.
    There are five compliance test configurations in this demo: PD_COMPLIANCE_TEST_DRP, PD_COMPLIANCE_TEST_DRP_TRY_SNK, PD_COMPLIANCE_TEST_DRP_TRY_SRC, PD_COMPLIANCE_TEST_CONSUMER_PROVIDER and PD_COMPLIANCE_TEST_PROVIDER_CONSUMER. There are five VIF files in the VIF directory corresponding to these five configurations.
